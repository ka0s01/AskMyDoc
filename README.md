Stuff to add
- file history
-switch between chats
-chatgpt style ux
-improve on the overall ui
- change the full structure. i dont like the way it says upload and view. instead just add a smaller heading followed by the drag and drop part then there should be an option to show extracted text instead of always displaying it
